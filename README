Polly - Polyhedral optimizations for LLVM
-----------------------------------------
http://polly.llvm.org/

Polly uses a mathematical representation, the polyhedral model, to represent and
transform loops and other control flow structures. Using an abstract
representation it is possible to reason about transformations in a more general
way and to use highly optimized linear programming libraries to figure out the
optimal loop structure. These transformations can be used to do constant
propagation through arrays, remove dead loop iterations, optimize loops for
cache locality, optimize arrays, apply advanced automatic parallelization, drive
vectorization, or they can be used to do software pipelining.


Alternative LLVM OpenMP backend
-------------------------------

Information:
  This implementation is based on "release_40" of Polly.

Usage:
  The CL switch "polly-omp-backend" allows to choose the OpenMP-backend.
    0: GNU OpenMP (default)
    1: LLVM OpenMP
  
The LLVM OpenMP backend can be further influenced using the following CL switches:
  "polly-lomp-num-threads": Number of threads to use
  (default: 0 = auto/OMP runtime)
  "polly-lomp-scheduling": Int representation of the KMPC scheduling
  (default: 34 = kmp_sch_static)
  "polly-lomp-chunksize": Chunksize to use by the KMPC runtime calls
  (default: 1)
    
  Example: Use alternative backend with dynamic scheduling (kmp_sch_dynamic_chunked),
  chunksize 1 and 4 threads.
  "-mllvm -polly-omp-backend=1 -mllvm -polly-lomp-num-threads=4 -mllvm
  -polly-lomp-chunksize=1 -mllvm -polly-lomp-scheduling=35"

Known issues:
  The "loc struct" is only a dummy and therefore does not provide any useful info.
